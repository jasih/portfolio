# Portfolio
A clean and simple porfolio webpage written in Javascript, HTML, CSS, and SCSS.

## Techologies Used
To get similar results, here are the tools and technologies that I used:
 
   #### Programming
    Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, SCSS 

   #### Software
    Visual Studio Code, Github

   #### Operating Systems
    Windows

   #### Fonts + Images
    Google Fonts, Font Awesome

## How To Run
Assuming that you have some experience with github repos...

1. Before you run...
- Install these extensions (if you haven't already!)
    - Sass (current version: `v1.8.26`)
    - Live Server (current version: `v5.7.9`)
2. Running
- Once you have cloned it and installed the above mentioned extensions, follow these simple steps:
    - Open the folder in VSCode
    - On the left-hand side, click on the file named: `index.html`
    - Right-click anywhere in the `html` file and Select `Live Server` 
    
         ***OR***
    
    - Find the html file on the left-hand side, right-click it, and select `Open with Live Server`
 
Live Server should create a new page on your browser, and you should be able to see and interact with my portfolio.
      
Good job! You successfully did it!!!

   - Media queries for changing window size of the web page.
   - Interactive button to `Download CV` (has *cool* animations: on hover ---> background changes color + does a short sliding transition).
